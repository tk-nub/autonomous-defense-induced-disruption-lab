# Autonomous Defense Induced Disruption Lab

Hybrid enterprise lab environment for researching **Autonomous Defense Induced Disruption (ADID)**.  
This repository provides infrastructure build scripts and step-by-step instructions for recreating a hybrid enterprise environment used to study AI-driven autonomous containment behavior.

## Purpose of the Lab Environment

This lab was designed to:

- Simulate a modern hybrid enterprise architecture  
- Integrate on-premises Active Directory with cloud identity services  
- Generate cross-domain telemetry across identity and endpoint layers  
- Enable autonomous containment actions across identity and endpoint control planes  
- Reproduce enterprise conditions required to test Attack Disruption scenarios  

---

## What the Lab Framework Provides

- Preconfigured virtual machine templates  
- Step-by-step hybrid deployment guidance  
- Active Directory domain controllers and Windows Server roles  
- Domain-joined Windows 11 enterprise endpoints  
- Test identities and user objects  
- Azure AD (Entra ID) and Microsoft 365 integration

## High-Level Architecture

### On-Premises Infrastructure
- Active Directory Domain Controller  
- Windows Server infrastructure services  
- Domain-joined Windows 11 endpoints  

### Cloud Services
- Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID)  
- Microsoft 365 E5 tenant  
- Microsoft Defender XDR  

---

## Scope of This Repository

This repository contains:

- Lab build instructions  
- Infrastructure configuration scripts  
- Environment reconstruction guidance  

Detection, investigation, and automated containment actions occur within Microsoft Defender XDR and are triggered through simulated activity generated by this lab environment.

## Research Focus

This lab supports experimentation and analysis of:

- AI-driven autonomous response systems  
- Cross-domain containment behavior  
- Operational risks of automated security enforcement  
- Autonomous Defense Induced Disruption (ADID) scenarios

## Intended Use

This environment is provided for:

- Security research  
- Controlled experimentation  
- Educational use  
- Reproducible lab simulation  

It is not intended for production deployment.
